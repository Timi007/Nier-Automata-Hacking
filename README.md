# Nier: Automata Hacking

A game based on the hacking mini game in Nier: Automata.  
It's written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) using [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js).

This game was a uni project of mine.

If you want to build this game from the source, you need [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Installing build dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Running development live server:
```
npm start
```

Building production files:

```

## Credit

This project is using the YoRHa CSS from [metakirby5](https://github.com/metakirby5/yorha) and sound from [Amazuraa](https://github.com/Amazuraa/YoRHa-Hacking-Game).  
It was also inspired by [Mugen87s](https://github.com/Mugen87/nier) implementation of the game.
